# Containers

Speedwave uses OCI containers (via nerdctl) for isolation and reproducibility. Each project gets its own network and set of containers.

## Container Topology

Each project runs an isolated set of containers on a dedicated network:

```
speedwave_<project>_network
├── speedwave_<project>_claude      # Claude Code — no tokens, no container socket
├── speedwave_<project>_mcp_hub     # MCP Hub (port 4000) — ONLY MCP server Claude sees
│   ├── search_tools                # Discovers OS tools alongside Slack, GitLab, etc.
│   ├── execute_code                # os.listReminders(), os.createEvent(), etc.
│   └── HTTP bridge                 # Routes to mcp-os on host via WORKER_OS_URL
└── speedwave_<project>_mcp_<service>  # Per-service workers (own tokens only)
```

- The Claude container has **no tokens** and **no container socket** — it communicates only with the MCP Hub
- Each MCP worker mounts only its own service credentials at `/tokens` (read-only)
- The Hub has **zero tokens** and acts as a router

## Compose Template

`containers/compose.template.yml` is the **SSOT** for container definitions:

- `render_compose()` in `crates/speedwave-runtime/src/compose.rs` generates per-project compose files from the template
- Never hand-edit generated compose files — modify the template instead
- Addon services are merged into the compose document by `compose.rs`

## Image Build

- Containerfiles live in `containers/` (e.g., `Containerfile.claude`, `containers/mcp-servers/Containerfile.mcp-base`)
- `scripts/bundle-build-context.sh` bundles MCP sources into Tauri resources for Desktop builds
- The `IMAGES` constant in `crates/speedwave-runtime/src/build.rs` must stay aligned with `scripts/bundle-build-context.sh`
- All binary downloads in Containerfiles are **SHA256-verified** for supply chain security

## Dynamic Port Reconciliation (mcp-os)

The mcp-os process runs on the host (not in a container) and binds to a dynamic port at startup. When the Desktop app starts — or when the mcp-os watchdog respawns a crashed process — the new port may differ from the `WORKER_OS_URL` baked into the running compose configuration.

`reconcile_compose_port` runs in a background thread to fix this:

1. Reads the current mcp-os port from `~/.speedwave/mcp-os.port`
2. Reads the active compose file and checks `WORKER_OS_URL` for a matching port
3. If the port is stale, regenerates the compose YAML via `render_compose()`, runs the security check, and saves the new compose file
4. Calls `compose_up_recreate` to recreate containers with the updated `WORKER_OS_URL`
5. Emits a `containers_reconciled` Tauri event to notify the frontend

This ensures the MCP Hub always routes OS integration requests to the live mcp-os instance, even after process restarts.

## Reconcile Guard (Image Readiness)

When Speedwave detects a bundle change (e.g. after an app update), it rebuilds container images in a background thread (`reconcile_bundle_update`). During this time, any operation that starts containers (`start_containers`, `add_project`, `recreate_project_containers`, `switch_project`) will block via `ensure_images_ready()` until images are ready.

The mechanism uses a `Condvar` with tri-state `ImageReadiness` (`Ready`, `Building`, `Failed`):

- **Before reconcile spawn**: state set to `Building`
- **After images built**: state set to `Ready`, all waiters unblocked
- **On error or panic**: state set to `Failed`, all waiters unblocked with error
- **Scope guard**: ensures `Building→Failed` transition even if the reconcile thread panics

The Desktop frontend shows a unified blocking overlay in the Shell component while containers are not ready (checking, starting, switching, rebuilding states).
