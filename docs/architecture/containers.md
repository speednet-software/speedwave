# Containers

Speedwave uses OCI containers (via nerdctl) for isolation and reproducibility. Each project gets its own network and set of containers.

## Container Topology

Each project runs an isolated set of containers on a dedicated network:

```
speedwave_<project>_network
├── speedwave_<project>_claude      # Claude Code — no tokens, no container socket
├── speedwave_<project>_mcp_hub     # MCP Hub (port 4000) — ONLY MCP server Claude sees
│   ├── search_tools                # Discovers OS tools alongside Slack, GitLab, etc.
│   ├── execute_code                # os.listReminders(), os.createEvent(), etc.
│   └── HTTP bridge                 # Routes to mcp-os on host via WORKER_OS_URL
└── speedwave_<project>_mcp_<service>  # Per-service workers (own tokens only)
```

- The Claude container has **no tokens** and **no container socket** — it communicates only with the MCP Hub
- Each MCP worker mounts only its own service credentials at `/tokens` (read-only)
- The Hub has **zero tokens** and acts as a router

## Compose Template

`containers/compose.template.yml` is the **SSOT** for container definitions:

- `render_compose()` in `crates/speedwave-runtime/src/compose.rs` generates per-project compose files from the template
- Never hand-edit generated compose files — modify the template instead
- Addon services are merged into the compose document by `compose.rs`

## Image Build

- Containerfiles live in `containers/` (e.g., `Containerfile.claude`, `containers/mcp-servers/Containerfile.mcp-base`)
- `scripts/bundle-build-context.sh` bundles MCP sources into Tauri resources for Desktop builds
- The `IMAGES` constant in `crates/speedwave-runtime/src/build.rs` must stay aligned with `scripts/bundle-build-context.sh`
- All binary downloads in Containerfiles are **SHA256-verified** for supply chain security
